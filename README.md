# project-tracker
A motivational app to help me keep track of progress on various things I've begun but not finished.

Things to track and how to track them

- DIY Projects
  - Vector of Projects
    - Goal
    - Requisite Resources
      - Have
      - Need
    - Steps to Complete
      - CRUD
        - Update: be able to insert or move steps
      - Visualize percentage of steps completed
    - Motivation
      - Get user input for recitation about what user is looking forward to about the projet
      - Look at next sequential step to complete and ask user: can you complete this step today?

- Books To Read
  - Vector of books
    - Print books marked unread
    - Print books marked unfinished
      - Updater:
        - Is page count or percentage?
        - If page count, get total pages and convert to percentage each time user updates current page
        - Option to mark as read (completion to 100, read flag)
    - Print books marked read
  - Vector of books to start (is this more or less complicated than including this as a flag and putting all the books in one vector?)
