# project-tracker
A motivational app to help me keep track of progress on various things I've begun but not finished.

Things to track and how to track them

DIY Projects
  Project
    Goal
    Requisite Resources
      Have
      Need
    Steps to Complete
      CRUD
        For Update: be able to insert or move steps
      Visualize percentage of steps completed
    Motivation
      Get user input for recitation about what user is looking forward to about the projet
      Look at next sequential step to complete and ask user: can you complete this step today?

Books To Read
  Vector of books
    Print books marked unread
    Print books marked unfinished
      Updater:
        Is page count or percentage?
        If page count, get total pages and convert to percentage each time user updates current page
        Option to mark as read (completion to 100, read flag)
    Print books marked read
  Vector of books to start (is this more or less complicated than including this as a flag and putting all the books in one vector?)
